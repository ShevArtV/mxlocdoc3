# mxLocDoc

Lightweight MODX Revolution 3 extra for reading local Markdown documentation inside the MODX manager.

Current status: MODX 3 package with system settings, secure filesystem
services, Markdown navigation, safe Markdown rendering with protected asset
URLs, a vanilla JS/CSS manager docs UI, multilingual documentation roots,
cached filesystem live-search, and a built `2.0.0-pl` transport package.
Requires MODX >= 3.0 and PHP >= 8.1.

User documentation is available in [`docs/`](docs/). The package also ships the
same documentation for the built-in MODX manager viewer.

## Core Decisions

- MODX 3 package.
- Built with the `modxapp` package builder.
- Service layer is PSR-4 (`MxLocDoc\`) with composer autoload; the `mxlocdoc` service is registered in the MODX 3 DI container via `bootstrap.php`.
- Manager UI as a lightweight CMP with vanilla JS/CSS.
- No VitePress, Node, Vue, Vite, or separate frontend build pipeline.
- Documentation root comes from the `mxlocdoc.docs_path` system setting; the default uses `[[+corePath]]components/mxlocdoc/docs/`.
- If the docs root contains language folders such as `en/` and `ru/`, the manager UI shows a language selector. The default selected language is the manager language when it exists.
- Navigation comes from `_sidebar.json` or `mxlocdoc.json`, with filesystem fallback.
- Markdown is rendered server-side with safe HTML handling.
- Relative Markdown images are served through a protected connector.
- Search scans `.md` files by title, path and body and caches the prepared index in `core/cache/mxlocdoc`.
- MODX manager cache clear also clears mxLocDoc cache through the `mxLocDocCacheClear` plugin on `OnBeforeCacheUpdate`.
- Markdown rendering uses vendored Parsedown in safe mode.
